### Two Sample T Test in R

## Set working directory

## Read in the data

## Check that data read in properly

### Check T Test assumptions

## Number of observations/variables (rows/columns)

## See variable names

## Count the number of patients of each gender

## Mean, variance, and median of age

## Create boxplot of age

## Create histogram of age

## Create boxplot of age, divided by gender

## Create histogram of age, divided by gender (more complicated)

## Draw Q-Q plot of age for males and females


### Perform T test

## Unpooled T test

## Pooled T test


## Conclusion: 

## F test for equality of variances
